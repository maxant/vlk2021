                    This picture is called "Anime drawing thing" and I'm very proud of it, especially the shading.
                    My OCs name is Blossom and everything I used was from a <a href='https://scrawlrbox.uk/' target='_blank'>Scrawlrbox</a>.

                    I called this illustration "Attempt of hot Naruto" and it was an attempt to make him not as boxy
                    and look handsome.

                    This is the first anime drawing I have done manually. I'm a self taught artist and so
                    I'm very proud of this being my very first anime drawing. Her name is Nina.

                    This is some fanaf fan art of Spring Trap, a.k.a. William Afton and how he got trapped in the 
                    spring lock suit and died.

                <td>
                    This is a drawing of a self conscious girl and the imagination getting the worst of her.
                    She's imagining all her class mates making fun of her when she's trying to do a presentation,
                    including her crush. She doesn't yet have a name, and I'm not done yet.

                    I made it so that Shoto got hit by a strawberry cow quirk and for some reason decided
                    to make him shirtless. Again it some fan art.

                    These are some random video game character designs because one of my dreams is to make
                    a video game with the help of my dad for the programming and I would do the drawing.
